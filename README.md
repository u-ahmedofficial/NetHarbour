<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 <!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot1]] -->

<!-- There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need. -->

There are many great SOLUTIONS available for this kind of attacks, however, I didn't find one that really suits needs of students for learning about the basic mitigation techniques. I want to make a solution for the students so that they can understand these types of attacks and possible techniques to prevent those.



I am doing this because:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a simple script from scratch.

Of course, no one solution will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### Built With
<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples. -->

* [Python](https://python.org)
